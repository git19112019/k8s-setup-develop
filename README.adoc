= Kubernetes Development Workflow with Skaffold and Kustomize
:experimental:

== Pre-requisites

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/[minikube]
* https://https://skaffold.dev/[Skaffold]
* https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/
* https://kustomize.io/
* https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/  (Optional)
* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] (Optional)

== Setup Kubernetes Cluster

[source,bash]
----
minikube profile demo-store
minikube start -p demo-store --memory=8192 --cpus=4 --disk-size=50g #<1>
eval $(minikube docker-env) #<2>
----

Or 

[source,bash]
----
kind create cluster â€”name demo-store
kubectl cluster-info --context demo-store
----

<1> Please add the other needed options as per your operating system
<2> Make the current docker context to be that of minikube

== Run Skaffold

[IMPORTANT]
====
In both development mode, the container image will not be pushed to remote container registry.
====

[source,bash]
----
skaffold dev --port-forward #<1>
----
<1> Run skaffold in `dev` mode. The **port-forward** option automatically forward the Kubernetes service port(default is 8080) to localhost port (default is 8080). By default it maps the application service port `8080` to host `8080`

[NOTE]
====
* The first build will be bit slower as it needs to cache the libs used
* You can watch the status via `kubectl get pods -w `, use kbd:[Ctrl+c] to terminate the watch
====

Once you see your application running (if you had deployed earlier):

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
develop-customers-6f99cbb648-lsqwh             1/1     Running   0          5s
develop-products-8f99cdd856-lgqex              1/1     Running   0          5s
----

Try opening the url http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/customers or http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/products 

Now make any changes to the sources in your editor and try refreshing the browser you will see the microservices live reload happening as usual on the terminal where you had started `skaffold dev` without the `` redeployed.

[TIP]
====
I personally recommend https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[WSL] and https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview[VS Code Remote Development]

=== Cleanup 

To delete the application:

[source,bash]
----
skaffold delete
----
